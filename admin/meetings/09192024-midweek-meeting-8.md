### Review Weekly Progress
- Code standardization has been started for a few of the files - Jonathan wrote comments on the git for the changes he made as a way to keep the discussion open for possible other changes.
- MongoDB progress is still being made with the user authentification page.
    - Pansy's feedback was to incorporate react components into the code so that the process of connecting/authenticating the information via MongoDB is simplified.
 
### Moving Forward
- Tia/Jonathan will continue to work more on the code standardization going forward.
- Gowtham/Vinod will work on figuring out how to incorporate the react components into the code.
