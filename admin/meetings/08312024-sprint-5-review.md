### Review Weekly Progress
- Progress has been made on MongoDB
    - using Mirabelle to download files as a .csv file
        - The file generated gives everything that we need in terms of information that would be given per item (ingredients, nutrition facts, etc.)
    - Every product is represented as a MongoDB object - 182 fields which might be why its taking up so much space.
- Grocery List + User Authentification are finished.

### Moving Forward
- MongoDB is pretty much ready to start working with it.
    - Open food database has sampler images too.
- Authentification is gonna get pushed + tested later.
