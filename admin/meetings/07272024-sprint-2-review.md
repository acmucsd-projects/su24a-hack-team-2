### Wrap Up Week 2
- Discussed what each member has been working on:
  - HTML/CSS:
    - Landing page is complete.
  - MongoDB has been set up.

### Plans for Week 3
- Continue working on the HTML/CSS for the individual pages.
  - **Issues have been made on Github, so please assign yourself to one if you're working on it!**
    - That way we know what is being worked on adn what still needs to be completed.
    - The Login one is not too important yet (focused on Javascript and less on HTML/CSS)
- MongoDB set up is still ongoing.

### Tips
(Literally just putting this here because I didn't know)
- To see the edits on the webpage as you're working on it, download [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on VSCode.
