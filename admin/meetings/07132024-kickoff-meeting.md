### Project Proposal:
**Summary:** Go Go Grocery will allow the user to create their grocery list, keeping track of various nutritional information and estimate prices locally. This will be within the budget the user set and the final list will be sent to the user.

- **Create it against Budget** &rarr; Users can set a budget prior to building their list. As items are added, the budget will deduct the price of each good.
- **Nutrition Counter** &rarr; Common grocery items will have various nutritional information tracked and will be presented when selected by the user.
- **Price Compare** &rarr; Allows users to list items and stores they wish to compare in price. Showing estimates for prices and how they compare to other stores.
    - User can modify the number of columns, with each column representing a grocery store
    - Each item in each column representing a certain good, each item is in-line with each column
    - Dropdown menu on top of column to represent various grocery stores you can choose from
- **Send out completed list** &rarr; Upon completion of list, send the user the completed version of the list. (SMS, email, etc. kinda idea)

### Plans for Next Week:
- Work on Figma Wireframing
- Check with mentors about Kanban Board
