### Review Wireframe
Vinod and Gowtham walked the rest of the team through the wireframe they came up with during the Wednesday meeting.
- Jonathan went over the wireframe later on and made edits to review during Wednesday's meeting.

### Collections of Data
Four main collections of data:
1. Email *
2. Password *
3. Name *
4. Autosave product ids
    - So the grocery list is saved even after the user exits the website.

\* 1, 2, and 3 are being saved for login authentification.

### Product Information
Currently 5 main components for the product:
1. Name
2. Image
3. Nutritional Facts
- Most likely summarized instead of an actual label
4. Price comparison between stores
5. Id (auto increment most likely)

### APIs / Databases
Nutrition Facts Link: [https://world.openfoodfacts.org/](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)

Product Information: [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database/
](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database/
)

Big list with a lot of apis lol: [https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#food--drink](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#food--drink)

- Worst case: would have crawlers scraping the internet for data from each store.

### Coding Set Up
**Update 07/23** Repository was kinda broken so original plan was for base of website to be shown at Wednesday's meeting. 
- Mainly be bare bones of the website : differing pages, etc.
