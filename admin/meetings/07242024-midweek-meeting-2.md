The team went over the final wireframe for the website.

### Coding Set Up
- Current work has been done mainly on the landing page (index.html & index.css)
  - Will be pushed later tonight.
- Need to split the webpages into separate html files. Current Plan:
  - **Page 1 and Page 4 = index.html & index.css**
  - **Page 5 = user-page.html**
  - **Page 6 = make-list.html**
  - **Page 7 = item-price.html**
  - **Page 2 = compare-stores.html**
  - **Page 8 = receipt.html**
- ***Each html will have its own css and js files.***
- main.css is standard across all pages (font, header color, etc.)
