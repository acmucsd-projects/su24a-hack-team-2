### Review Weekly Progress
- User Authentification Page:
    - Deleted the rest of the login features &rarr; now only login with email.
    - Connect to MongoDB with Node.js server
        - Uses parser.js and the www script given to connect to the MongoDB database.
        - Then use user schema and import into Parser.js &rarr; theoretically should post the name and email.
    - Connecting it worked because you're able to see the new connection for the users.
- Make-List page:
    - Added functionality to make list items clickable + allows for individual images/description to be shown per item.
- User Page:
    - Design is shifting to look more like Wireframe Page 9 to limit the amount of whitespace.
 
### Action Items for Next Week
- User Page is still being worked on.
- MongoDB still requires further testing.
- Make-List page nearly complete.

    - Volunteers: Possibly just switch off members (forgot to discuss)
    - Availability: (discuss more Wednesday - current discussion in Discord Chat)
